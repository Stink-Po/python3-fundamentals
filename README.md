# Python 3: Fundamentals Udemy Exercise

## **why I decide to do this course ?**

after a while learning python I find my knowledge in basic python concepts are 
not good and after some research I find this course on udemy :
 **https://www.udemy.com/course/python3-fundamentals/** By  [*Dr.Fred.Baptiste](https://github.com/fbaptiste)

very usefully I am writing this codes also with my past knowledge in programming so my answers to the course Exercise
not exactly same in the course 
in this course we will learn python in depth
